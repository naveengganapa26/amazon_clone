# Amazon Clone

This project is a simplified version of the Amazon website, developed as a learning project to understand web development fundamentals. It was my first project, where I explored building web applications independently.

## Features

- **User Interface**: A replica of the Amazon homepage, including a navbar, product listings, and footer.
- **Product Listings**: Displays products dynamically using sample data.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structuring the content of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling and designing the UI components.
